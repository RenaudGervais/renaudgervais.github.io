Inner garden is a project that was motivated by our desire to create a playful and mindful medium. Our system is inspired by both the reflective and metaphoric nature of zen gardens as well as the playful and experimental nature of sandboxes. Zen gardens are all about careful placement of elements and are often used for contemplative and meditative purposes. On the other hand, sandboxes call for interaction and experimentation. Our main goal was to create an ambient and meditative toy that could both include playful physical creation and contemplation.

The sand is used to create a miniature living world where the state of the world is influenced by the inner state of the user (measured with EEG or different physiological sensors). It can be used directly, by shaping the world itself by playing with the sand, but also can be used as an ambient display to reflect on the current state of the user.
