Teegi is a Tangible EEG (ElectroEncephaloGraphy) Interface. It uses a physical puppet on which your brain activity is displayed in real-time.

The main objective with Teegi was to enable novice users to get access to tools and visualizations that usually only experts have access to. By making the installation tangible, users can focus on the effect of certain activities (*e.g.* moving your hands or feet, closing your eyes or trying to relax/meditate) on the readings of their brain activity and therefore increasing their understanding of cerebral processes.

We think Teegi could be a tool very well suited to education purposes (*e.g.* scientific museums) or for use in BCI (Brain Computer Interfaces) training.
