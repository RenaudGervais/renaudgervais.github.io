Don't you feel trapped when working on a screen? On our desks, we often have two different workspaces: one for working digitally (screens) and one for working physically (sketches, post-its, prototypes). We think that this dichotomy is *limiting*.

We proposed to link the two working spaces using a metaphor we called *Tangible Viewports* and is a direct follow-up to the [CurSAR](/cursar-pointing-in-spatial-augmented-reality-from-2d-pointing-devices/) project.. It consists in an on-screen window where, when a physical object is held in front of it (from the point of view of the user), the cursor on screen "jumps" onto the physical object. Combined with Spatial Augmented Reality, it allowed us to connect to existing desktop applications, such as [Photoshop](http://www.adobe.com/fr/products/photoshop.html), to real objects.
