Two of our submission at TEI 2016 were accepted as full papers. The first one is [Tangible Viewports](/projects/tangible-viewports/), an hybrid workspace that allows the use of tangible augmented objects in a standard desktop computer workflow. The second one is [Tobe](/projects/tobe/), a toolkit for creating "Tangible Out-of-Body Experiences". It allows users to create and customize a tangible augmented avatar that displays real-time physiological feedback, in order to playfully learn more about their own inner selves.

We also got one poster accepted as a Work-in-Progress: [Inner Garden](/projects/inner-garden/), an augmented sandbox designed for self-reflection.
