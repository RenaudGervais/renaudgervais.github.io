I successfully defended my PhD thesis yesterday! I want to thank the great members of my jury for traveling to Bordeaux and for the rich insights they provided as well as my supervisor, Martin Hachet. Thank you so much for all the people that came to the event or was there in thoughts we me, I highly appreciated it!
