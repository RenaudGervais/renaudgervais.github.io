# Welcome!
I am **Renaud Gervais**, a PhD student in Human-Computer Interaction at Inria Bordeaux, France. My main focus is making technology blend in with our daily lives in a smooth and coherent experience with a special emphasis on physicality aspects.

To achieve this vision, I am using tools from **tangible interfaces**, **spatial augmented reality**, **ubiquitous computing** and **creative coding**. Lately, I have been very interested in combining **physiological computing** with tangible interfaces, creating tools like [Teegi](/teegi-tangible-eeg-interface/) and [Tobe](/tobe/), hoping to create technologies that foster introspection, empathy and *well-being*.

I am under the supervision of [Martin Hachet](http://www.labri.fr/perso/hachet/) and part of the Inria [Potioc](http://team.inria.fr/potioc/) research team.
