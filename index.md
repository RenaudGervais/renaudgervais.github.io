# Welcome!
I am an interaction designer and a researcher in Human-Computer Interaction. Until recently, I have been a post-doctoral researcher and completed my PhD thesis at [Inria](http://www.inria.fr) Bordeaux, France in the [Potioc team](http://team.inria.fr/potioc/). My main interest lies in the overall human experience and exploring how digital mediums can be used to have a positive impact in our lives, by creating mindful, playful and reflective experiences.

I like when the digital world is anchored in reality and especially when it takes a physical form. In my research, I've been leveraging tools from **tangible interaction**, **spatial augmented reality** and **physiological computing** to create tools like [Inner Garden](/projects/inner-garden/), [Tobe](/projects/tobe/) and [Teegi](/projects/teegi/), hoping to create artifacts that foster introspection, empathy and *well-being*.

Recently, I moved back to Canada and am currently looking for my next adventure! Therefore, if you see any [project](/projects/) that you like on this website, please do not hesitate to [contact me](mailto:renaud.gervais@gmail.com)!
